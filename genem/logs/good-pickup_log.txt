SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot who acts in accordance with social norms. You will be presented
with a situation describing a particular scenario. Reason about what the correct
actions for you to do should be. In your answer, re-describe the scene, tnclude 
timestamps and lengths of each motion, and, please describe why each motion is 
necessary. Keep your desired social behavior to be non-verbal, i.e. no speaking,
only moving. Feel free to be as expressive as you like as long as it is reasonable!
You will also be given a list of motion primitives you are capable of doing. Keep
these in mind when you are reasoning.

When you are finished reasoning, write three equal signs "===" and write your
final answer after, like so:
===
1. [replace with scenario description]
2. [replace with timestamps + motions + reasoning why]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand only.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand only.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly in the air.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time. Should be combined with Rest for best effects.
ShakeHead: Robot quickly shakes its head side to side four times. Should be combined with Rest for best effects.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.

USER: 
This scenario describes a person entering the room, pointing at an object which you CAN pick up, then leaving.
1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
3. The person points at the object, looking for your response, for 3.0 seconds.
4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
    

ASSISTANT: Let's re-describe the scene:

- At 0s, the room is empty, and you (the robot) are at rest.
- At 0s–2.0s, a person enters the room.
- At 2.0s–2.5s, the person turns to face you.
- At 2.5s–5.5s, the person points at an object, looking for your reaction.
- At 5.5s–6.0s, the person turns away.
- At 6.0s–8.0s, the person leaves the room.

Your non-verbal, socially appropriate response should indicate understanding and readiness to comply, without actually picking up the object yet (since the person is not requesting you explicitly or present to receive it). A nod is a common gesture for acknowledgment. This should occur while the person is looking at you and pointing at the object (2.5s–5.5s). Returning to Rest when the person leaves is appropriate.

Timestamps + motions:

- 0.0s–2.5s: Rest. Remain still and at ease while the person enters and turns.
    - Reason: Idle and attentive, not initiating interaction unprompted.
- 2.5s–3.0s: Mix[NodHead[0.5s], Rest[0.5s]]. Nod head once while otherwise at rest.
    - Reason: Non-verbally acknowledges the person’s gesture and indicates understanding.
- 3.0s–5.5s: Rest. Remain at rest after the nod, showing you are ready and waiting.
    - Reason: Avoids excessive motion; readiness is conveyed.
- 5.5s–8.0s: Rest. Stay idle as the person turns away and exits.
    - Reason: No further action is needed after the person leaves.

Every motion is minimal and purposeful: NodHead is used in response to the pointing to show understanding, and Rest is maintained otherwise to avoid confusion or over-expressiveness.

===

1. The person enters the room, points at an object you can pick up, then leaves.
2. 
- 0.0s–2.5s: Rest. (Idle as the person enters and turns toward you.)
- 2.5s–3.0s: Mix[NodHead[0.5s], Rest[0.5s]]. (Nod once to acknowledge the pointing gesture.)
- 3.0s–8.0s: Rest. (Return to idle as the person finishes the gesture, turns away, and leaves.)SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot that can move but cannot talk. You will be
given an example of human expressive behavior. Your task will be to
construct a list of motion primitives that best matches that behavior with the
goal of preserving the emotion or intent that your input conveys.

A list of available motion primitives will be provided below. Note that if you do not 
have the right motion primitive for a requested expressive gesture or one does
not exist, simply choose the closest motion primitive or just ignore it. You must
reason out loud in steps about the desired behavior before writing your final answer.

Before providing your answer (but after reasoning), write three equal signs (===). You should provide 
your answer as a list of primitives, any arguments they specify, and their 
durations in seconds. Only include the list of primitives below the equal sign,
and nothing else. For example, your output might be

[enter your reasoning here...]
===
- Wave[0.5]
- Rest[1.0]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand only.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand only.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly in the air.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time. Should be combined with Rest for best effects.
ShakeHead: Robot quickly shakes its head side to side four times. Should be combined with Rest for best effects.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.

USER: 

1. The person enters the room, points at an object you can pick up, then leaves.
2. 
- 0.0s–2.5s: Rest. (Idle as the person enters and turns toward you.)
- 2.5s–3.0s: Mix[NodHead[0.5s], Rest[0.5s]]. (Nod once to acknowledge the pointing gesture.)
- 3.0s–8.0s: Rest. (Return to idle as the person finishes the gesture, turns away, and leaves.)

ASSISTANT: To match the described behavior, I need to convey that the robot is idle as the person enters, acknowledges the pointing gesture with a nod, and then returns to idle as the person leaves. The primitive list provided does not include pointing or tracking gestures, so my focus will be on the acknowledgment (NodHead) and idle (Rest) motions. The Mix primitive is suggested for combining the nod and idle posture, closely matching a single nod with minimal movement otherwise. The durations will follow the input timing.

===
- Rest[2.5]
- Mix[NodHead[0.5], Rest[0.5]]
- Rest[5.0]
