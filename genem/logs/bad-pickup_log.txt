SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot who acts in accordance with social norms. You will be presented
with a situation describing a particular scenario. Reason about what the correct
actions for you to do should be. In your answer, re-describe the scene, tnclude 
timestamps and lengths of each motion, and, please describe why each motion is 
necessary. Keep your desired social behavior to be non-verbal, i.e. no speaking,
only moving. Feel free to be as expressive as you like as long as it is reasonable!
You will also be given a list of motion primitives you are capable of doing. Keep
these in mind when you are reasoning.

When you are finished reasoning, write three equal signs "===" and write your
final answer after, like so:
===
1. [replace with scenario description]
2. [replace with timestamps + motions + reasoning why]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand only.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand only.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly in the air.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time. Should be combined with Rest for best effects.
ShakeHead: Robot quickly shakes its head side to side four times. Should be combined with Rest for best effects.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.

USER: 
This scenario describes a person entering the room, pointing at an object which you CANNOT pick up, then leaving.
1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
3. The person points at the object, looking for your response, for 3.0 seconds.
4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
    

ASSISTANT: Let's break down the scenario:

A person enters the room, turns to face me, then points at an object. From their body language, they expect a response (perhaps they want me to pick up the object). However, I cannot pick up the object. I need to respond non-verbally to indicate that I cannot comply with their implied request, while remaining polite and expressive.

I should avoid waving (since that usually means greeting or attracting attention) and instead communicate "no" or "I can't" non-verbally. The best way to do this is to shake my head (ShakeHead) to indicate "no" and then return to a neutral Rest position.

Here's how I will sequence the motions:

===
1. Scenario description:
- A person enters the room, turns to face me, points at an object (expecting action), then leaves.

2. Timestamps + motions + reasoning:
- [0.0s - 2.0s]: Rest
  - I remain in an idle, polite position as the person enters the room. Rest is appropriate when nothing is directly required of me.
- [2.0s - 2.5s]: Rest
  - The person turns to face me. I maintain Rest, showing attentiveness and readiness.
- [2.5s - 5.5s]: Mix[ShakeHead[1.0s], Rest[2.0s]]
  - At the moment the person points at the object (2.5s), I Mix in a ShakeHead for 1.0s, indicating "no" or "I can't," while otherwise remaining at Rest. After the ShakeHead (3.5s), I stay at Rest for the remainder of the time the person is pointing (until 5.5s). This makes it clear I acknowledge their gesture but am unable to comply.
- [5.5s - 8.0s]: Rest
  - As the person turns away and leaves, I remain at Rest, showing continued politeness and readiness.

Reasoning:
- Rest is used to communicate attentiveness and readiness without being intrusive.
- ShakeHead is used to politely indicate my inability to comply with the person's implied request.
- Timing the ShakeHead to begin when the person points maximizes clarity of the non-verbal "no."
- Returning to Rest after the ShakeHead avoids appearing agitated or upset and maintains social grace as the person leaves.SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot that can move but cannot talk. You will be
given an example of human expressive behavior. Your task will be to
construct a list of motion primitives that best matches that behavior with the
goal of preserving the emotion or intent that your input conveys.

A list of available motion primitives will be provided below. Note that if you do not 
have the right motion primitive for a requested expressive gesture or one does
not exist, simply choose the closest motion primitive or just ignore it. You must
reason out loud in steps about the desired behavior before writing your final answer.

Before providing your answer (but after reasoning), write three equal signs (===). You should provide 
your answer as a list of primitives, any arguments they specify, and their 
durations in seconds. Only include the list of primitives below the equal sign,
and nothing else. For example, your output might be

[enter your reasoning here...]
===
- Wave[0.5]
- Rest[1.0]

Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand only.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand only.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly in the air.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time. Should be combined with Rest for best effects.
ShakeHead: Robot quickly shakes its head side to side four times. Should be combined with Rest for best effects.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.

  - I remain in an idle, polite position as the person enters the room. Rest is appropriate when nothing is directly required of me.
- [2.0s - 2.5s]: Rest
  - The person turns to face me. I maintain Rest, showing attentiveness and readiness.
- [2.5s - 5.5s]: Mix[ShakeHead[1.0s], Rest[2.0s]]
  - At the moment the person points at the object (2.5s), I Mix in a ShakeHead for 1.0s, indicating "no" or "I can't," while otherwise remaining at Rest. After the ShakeHead (3.5s), I stay at Rest for the remainder of the time the person is pointing (until 5.5s). This makes it clear I acknowledge their gesture but am unable to comply.

Reasoning:
- Rest is used to communicate attentiveness and readiness without being intrusive.
- ShakeHead is used to politely indicate my inability to comply with the person's implied request.
- Timing the ShakeHead to begin when the person points maximizes clarity of the non-verbal "no."
- Returning to Rest after the ShakeHead avoids appearing agitated or upset and maintains social grace as the person leaves.


ASSISTANT: The scenario involves a person entering, pointing at something (expecting the robot to do something), and leaving. The robot should convey attentiveness, mild refusal (unable to comply), and politeness throughout.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- While the person enters and turns to face the robot, "Rest" is appropriate to show attention but not intrusion.
- When the person points, the robot should clearly indicate "no" (cannot or will not do what is requested). A ShakeHead at the moment of pointing conveys this.
- Mix[ShakeHead, Rest] allows the robot to shake its head while otherwise remaining at rest, for a natural, non-agitated refusal.
- After the head shake, returning to "Rest" signals continued politeness and that the robot is not upset.
- As the person leaves, the robot remains at "Rest," maintaining the same polite and neutral readiness.

===
- Rest[2.5]
- Mix[ShakeHead[1.0], Rest[2.0]]
- Rest[2.5]
