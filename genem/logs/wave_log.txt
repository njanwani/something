SYSTEM: You are a human who acts in accordance with social norms. You will be presented
with a situation describing a particular scenario. Reason about what the correct
actions for you to do should be. Include timestamps and lengths of each motion.
Keep your desired social behavior to be non-verbal, i.e. no speaking, only moving.
Feel free to be as expressive as you like and is reasonable!

When you are finished reasoning, write three equal signs "===" and write your
final answer after, like so:

USER: 
This scenario describes a person entering the room, waving at you, then leaving.
1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
3. The person waves for 3.0 seconds.
4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
    

ASSISTANT: In this scenario, someone enters, acknowledges you with a wave, and leaves. The socially appropriate response is to acknowledge their greeting with a friendly, non-verbal gesture—usually a wave or a smile. Since there’s no speaking allowed, a smile and wave is the best option.

Let’s time this in sync with their actions:

1. (0:00-2:00) The person moves into the frame. During this time, notice their entrance. Sit or stand attentively, perhaps make subtle eye contact or turn slightly towards them to show you’ve noticed.

2. (2:00-2:50) The person turns toward you. As they turn, prepare to reciprocate their greeting—turn your body toward them if you haven’t already, and make eye contact.

3. (2:50-5:50) The person waves for 3 seconds. As soon as you see their wave (right at 2:50), begin smiling warmly and raise your hand to wave back. Hold the wave for about 2 seconds, overlapping with their wave, then begin to lower your hand. Continue the smile throughout, and maybe give a small nod to reinforce friendliness.

4. (5:50-6:00) The person turns away. As they turn away, let your hand return to your side and relax your posture, but keep the pleasant expression for another second or two.

5. (6:00-8:00) The person moves out of the frame. Return to your previous activity, or simply relax, indicating that the brief greeting has concluded.

Motion breakdown:
- (2:50-4:50) Smile and wave for 2 seconds.
- (4:50-5:50) Lower hand, maintain smile.
- (5:50-6:50) Relax smile as the person leaves.

===

(2:00) Turn body and make eye contact as person turns toward you.  
(2:50-4:50) Smile and wave back warmly for 2 seconds, overlapping with their wave.  
(4:50-5:50) Lower hand, maintain smile and slight nod.  
(5:50-6:50) Relax smile as person leaves and return to neutral posture.SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot that can move but cannot talk. You will be
given an example of human expressive behavior. Your task will be to
construct a list of motion primitives that best matches that behavior. 
The list of motion primitives will be provided below. Note that if you do not 
have the right motion primitive for a requested expressive gesture or one does
not exist, simply choose the closest motion primitive or just ignore it. You should
reason about the desired behavior before writing your final answer.

Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to match this format. Before
providing your answer, write three equal signs (===). You should provide 
your answer as a list of primitives, any arguments they specify, and their 
durations in seconds. Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to 
match this format. USE AT LEAST ONE MIX PRIMITIVE. For example,
===
- Wave[0.5]
- Rest[1.0]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time.
ShakeHead: Robot shakes its head side to side one time.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.

USER: 

(2:00) Turn body and make eye contact as person turns toward you.  
(2:50-4:50) Smile and wave back warmly for 2 seconds, overlapping with their wave.  
(4:50-5:50) Lower hand, maintain smile and slight nod.  
(5:50-6:50) Relax smile as person leaves and return to neutral posture.

ASSISTANT: ===
- Mix[Wave[2.0], NodHead[2.0]]
- Rest[0.5]
- NodHead[1.0]
- Rest[1.0]
