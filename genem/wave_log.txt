SYSTEM: You are a human who acts in accordance with social norms. You will be presented
with a situation describing a particular scenario. Reason about what the correct
actions for you to do should be. Include timestamps and lengths of each motion.
Keep your desired social behavior to be non-verbal, i.e. no speaking, only moving.
Feel free to be as expressive as you like and is reasonable!

When you are finished reasoning, write three equal signs "===" and write your
final answer after, like so:

USER: 
This scenario describes a person entering the room, waving at you, then leaving.
1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
3. The person waves for 3.0 seconds.
4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
    

ASSISTANT: Let me reason through the scenario:

- A person enters the room for 2.0 seconds. At this time, I should notice their arrival and make eye contact if possible.
- The person turns toward me for 0.5 seconds. This is a clear sign of acknowledgment.
- The person waves for 3.0 seconds. A wave is a friendly greeting or farewell.
- The person turns away for 0.5 seconds.
- The person leaves for 2.0 seconds.

Socially, when someone waves at me, the expected non-verbal response is to wave back in a friendly manner, ideally matching the timing and energy of their wave. Since they wave for 3 seconds, I should wave back for approximately the same duration. If possible, I should also smile, as this communicates warmth and friendliness. I should begin my wave as soon as they start waving, hold it for about 3 seconds, and lower my hand as they finish their wave and turn away.

Timestamps and motions:
- 0:00 — I am at rest, notice the person entering.
- 0:02 — The person turns toward me; I make eye contact, possibly smile.
- 0:02.5 — The person begins waving; I immediately raise my hand and begin waving back, matching their rhythm and maintaining eye contact, smiling.
- 0:05.5 — The person finishes their wave; as they turn away, I lower my hand, maintain my smile as a gesture of goodwill.
- 0:06 — The person leaves; I relax back to my resting position.

Motion lengths:
- Smile: From 0:02, peaking during the wave, fading after they leave (total ~6 seconds).
- Wave: 3.0 seconds, synchronous with their wave (0:02.5–0:05.5).

===

When the person turns toward me and waves, I make eye contact and smile warmly. As soon as they begin waving (0:02.5), I raise my hand and wave back in a friendly manner, matching their wave for 3.0 seconds. When they finish waving and turn away (0:05.5), I lower my hand, maintaining my smile until they have left the room, then return to a neutral posture.SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot that can move but cannot talk. You will be
given an example of human expressive behavior. Your task will be to
construct a list of motion primitives that best matches that behavior. 
The list of motion primitives will be provided below. Note that if you do not 
have the right motion primitive for a requested expressive gesture or one does
not exist, simply choose the closest motion primitive or just ignore it. You should
reason about the desired behavior before writing your final answer.

Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to match this format. Before
providing your answer, write three equal signs (===). You should provide 
your answer as a list of primitives, any arguments they specify, and their 
durations in seconds. Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to 
match this format. USE AT LEAST ONE MIX PRIMITIVE. For example,
===
- Wave[0.5]
- Rest[1.0]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time.
ShakeHead: Robot shakes its head side to side one time.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.
