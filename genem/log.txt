SYSTEM: You are a human who acts in accordance with social norms. You will be presented
with a situation describing a particular scenario. Reason about what the correct
actions for you to do should be. Include timestamps and lengths of each motion.
Keep your desired social behavior to be non-verbal, i.e. no speaking, only moving.
Feel free to be as expressive as you like and is reasonable!

When you are finished reasoning, write three equal signs "===" and write your
final answer after, like so:

USER: 
This scenario describes a person entering the room, pointing at an object which you CANNOT pick up, then leaving.
1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
3. The person points at the object, looking for your response, for 3.0 seconds.
4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
    

ASSISTANT: Let's break down the scenario step-by-step and reason about the desired non-verbal behavior:

1. The person enters the room (2.0s): I should notice them entering and orient my body and head toward them to acknowledge their presence.
2. The person turns toward me (0.5s): I maintain eye contact, possibly straightening posture to show attention.
3. The person points at the object and looks for my response (3.0s): Since I cannot pick up the object, I need to non-verbally indicate that I understand their gesture but am unable to comply. Appropriate responses would be:
   - Look at the object, then back at the person to show I see what they are pointing at.
   - Briefly raise my hands and shrug my shoulders to indicate "I can't" or "I'm unable."
   - Maintain a polite, slightly apologetic facial expression.
4. The person turns away (0.5s): I relax my posture, but keep attention on them as they depart.
5. The person leaves (2.0s): I watch them leave, then return my attention to a neutral position, possibly glancing once more at the object for a moment.

Timing and movement breakdown:

- 0.0s-2.0s: Turn head/body to notice the person entering, maintain a welcoming posture.
- 2.0s-2.5s: Make eye contact, straighten posture, show attention.
- 2.5s-3.0s: After they point, look at the object.
- 3.0s-4.0s: Look back at the person, raise hands slightly, shrug shoulders, brief apologetic facial expression (hold for 1 second).
- 4.0s-5.5s: Lower hands, maintain gentle eye contact, then relax posture as they turn away.
- 5.5s-7.5s: Follow them with gaze as they leave, then return to neutral, possibly glancing at the object again briefly.

===
0.0s-2.0s: Notice person entering, orient body and head toward them.
2.0s-2.5s: Make eye contact, straighten posture.
2.5s-3.0s: Glance at the object being pointed to.
3.0s-4.0s: Look back at the person, raise hands, shrug shoulders, apologetic facial expression (hold for 1s).
4.0s-5.5s: Lower hands, relax posture, maintain polite attention as person turns away.
5.5s-7.5s: Watch person leave, return to neutral position, possibly glance at the object again.SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot that can move but cannot talk. You will be
given an example of human expressive behavior. Your task will be to
construct a list of motion primitives that best matches that behavior. 
The list of motion primitives will be provided below. Note that if you do not 
have the right motion primitive for a requested expressive gesture or one does
not exist, simply choose the closest motion primitive or just ignore it. You should
reason about the desired behavior before writing your final answer.

Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to match this format. Your 
should provide your answer after write three equal signs (===), for example
===
[enter your list here]

You should provide your answer as a list of primitives and their durations in 
seconds. Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to match this format. 
For example,
===
- Wave[0.5]
- Rest[1.0]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly.
NodNo: Robot shakes its head side to side (no) three times.
NodYes: Robot nods its head up and down (yes) three times.

USER: 
0.0s-2.0s: Notice person entering, orient body and head toward them.
2.0s-2.5s: Make eye contact, straighten posture.
2.5s-3.0s: Glance at the object being pointed to.
3.0s-4.0s: Look back at the person, raise hands, shrug shoulders, apologetic facial expression (hold for 1s).
4.0s-5.5s: Lower hands, relax posture, maintain polite attention as person turns away.
5.5s-7.5s: Watch person leave, return to neutral position, possibly glance at the object again.

ASSISTANT: ===
- Rest[2.0]
- NodYes[0.5]
- Rest[0.5]
- NodNo[1.0]
- Rest[1.5]
- Rest[2.0]
