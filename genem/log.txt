SYSTEM: You are a human who acts in accordance with social norms. You will be presented
with a situation describing a particular scenario. Reason about what the correct
actions for you to do should be. Include timestamps and lengths of each motion.
Keep your desired social behavior to be non-verbal, i.e. no speaking, only moving.
Feel free to be as expressive as you like and is reasonable!

When you are finished reasoning, write three equal signs "===" and write your
final answer after, like so:

USER: 
This scenario describes a person entering the room, pointing at an object which you CANNOT pick up, then leaving.
1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
3. The person points at the object, looking for your response, for 3.0 seconds.
4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
    

ASSISTANT: Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Person enters (2.0s)
   - I notice the person entering. I should look up from what I'm doing and direct my gaze toward them, perhaps adjusting my posture to show attentiveness.

2. Person turns toward me (0.5s)
   - I maintain eye contact or at least keep my attention focused on them, remaining open and attentive.

3. Person points at the object, seeking my response (3.0s)
   - Since I cannot pick up the object, I need to indicate non-verbally that I understand their gesture but am unable to comply.
   - I should:
     - Look at where they are pointing (0.5s), then back at them (0.5s).
     - Shrug my shoulders mildly (1.0s) to indicate inability.
     - Perhaps spread my hands palms up or shake my head gently (1.0s) to reinforce the meaning.
     - Hold a regretful or apologetic facial expression.

4. Person turns away (0.5s)
   - My posture relaxes slightly, I watch them as they turn away, and my expression returns to neutral.

5. Person leaves (2.0s)
   - I track their movement with my gaze, maybe offer a small nod of acknowledgment or a soft, apologetic smile as they go.
   - Once they are gone, I return to my previous activity.

Summary of actions with timestamps/lengths:
- 2.0s: Look up and attend to person.
- 0.5s: Maintain attentive posture.
- 0.5s: Follow their pointing gesture to the object.
- 0.5s: Look back at them.
- 1.0s: Shrug shoulders.
- 1.0s: Spread hands, palms up, or gentle head shake; apologetic facial expression.
- 0.5s: Relax posture as they turn.
- 2.0s: Watch them leave, small nod or apologetic smile.
- Return to neutral.

===

As the person enters (2.0s), I look up and direct my attention toward them. As they turn to me (0.5s), I maintain an attentive posture. When they point at the object (3.0s), I follow their gesture with my eyes (0.5s), look back at them (0.5s), shrug my shoulders (1.0s), and spread my hands, palms up, or gently shake my head (1.0s), all while wearing a regretful or apologetic expression. As they turn away (0.5s), I relax my posture and watch them. As they leave (2.0s), I track them with my gaze, possibly offering a small apologetic smile or nod, and then return to my previous activity.SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot that can move but cannot talk. You will be
given an example of human expressive behavior. Your task will be to
construct a list of motion primitives that best matches that behavior. 
The list of motion primitives will be provided below. Note that if you do not 
have the right motion primitive for a requested expressive gesture or one does
not exist, simply choose the closest motion primitive or just ignore it. You should
reason about the desired behavior before writing your final answer.

Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to match this format. Before
providing your answer, write three equal signs (===). You should provide 
your answer as a list of primitives, any arguments they specify, and their 
durations in seconds. Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to 
match this format. USE AT LEAST ONE MIX PRIMITIVE. For example,
===
- Wave[0.5]
- Rest[1.0]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time.
ShakeHead: Robot shakes its head side to side one time.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.
