SYSTEM: You are a human who acts in accordance with social norms. You will be presented
with a situation describing a particular scenario. Reason about what the correct
actions for you to do should be. Include timestamps and lengths of each motion.
Keep your desired social behavior to be non-verbal, i.e. no speaking, only moving.
Feel free to be as expressive as you like and is reasonable!

When you are finished reasoning, write three equal signs "===" and write your
final answer after, like so:

USER: 
This scenario describes a person entering the room, waving at you, then leaving.
1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
3. The person waves for 3.0 seconds.
4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
    

ASSISTANT: Let's break down the scenario step by step and determine the socially appropriate, non-verbal response:

1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
   - As the person enters, it's polite to acknowledge their presence. I should make eye contact and orient my body slightly toward them as they arrive (starting at 0:00, lasting for 2.0 seconds).

2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
   - As they turn toward me, I maintain eye contact, perhaps with a gentle, friendly expression or a small smile (from 2.0 to 2.5 seconds).

3. The person waves for 3.0 seconds.
   - When the person waves, the appropriate response is to return the wave. I should raise my hand and wave back in a friendly manner, starting as soon as they begin waving (from 2.5 to 5.5 seconds). My wave should match the duration and energy of theirs—so for the full 3.0 seconds.

4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
   - As they turn away, I can lower my hand and let my facial expression relax, but still look in their direction out of courtesy (from 5.5 to 6.0 seconds).

5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
   - As they leave, I can follow their movement with my gaze briefly, then return to a neutral posture as they exit fully (from 6.0 to 8.0 seconds).

Overall, the whole response is non-verbal, warm, and acknowledges the person's greeting.

===
0:00–2:00: Notice person entering, turn body and face toward them.
2:00–2:50: Maintain eye contact, smile gently.
2:50–5:50: As they wave, raise hand and wave back in a friendly manner.
5:50–6:00: Lower hand as they turn away, keep polite attention.
6:00–8:00: Briefly follow their exit with your gaze, then relax into a neutral posture.SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot that can move but cannot talk. You will be
given an example of human expressive behavior. Your task will be to
construct a list of motion primitives that best matches that behavior. 
The list of motion primitives will be provided below. Note that if you do not 
have the right motion primitive for a requested expressive gesture or one does
not exist, simply choose the closest motion primitive or just ignore it. You should
reason about the desired behavior before writing your final answer.

Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to match this format. Before
providing your answer, write three equal signs (===). You should provide 
your answer as a list of primitives, any arguments they specify, and their 
durations in seconds. Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to 
match this format. USE AT LEAST ONE MIX PRIMITIVE. For example,
===
- Wave[0.5]
- Rest[1.0]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time.
ShakeHead: Robot shakes its head side to side one time.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.

USER: 
0:00–2:00: Notice person entering, turn body and face toward them.
2:00–2:50: Maintain eye contact, smile gently.
2:50–5:50: As they wave, raise hand and wave back in a friendly manner.
5:50–6:00: Lower hand as they turn away, keep polite attention.
6:00–8:00: Briefly follow their exit with your gaze, then relax into a neutral posture.

ASSISTANT: ===
- Rest[2.0]
- Mix[Rest[0.5], NodHead[0.5]]
- Rest[0.5]
- Mix[Rest[2.0], Wave[3.0]]
- Rest[0.1]
- Mix[Rest[1.0], NodHead[1.0]]
- Rest[2.0]
