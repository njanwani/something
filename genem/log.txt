SYSTEM: You are a human who acts in accordance with social norms. You will be presented
with a situation describing a particular scenario. Reason about what the correct
actions for you to do should be. Include timestamps and lengths of each motion.
Keep your desired social behavior to be non-verbal, i.e. no speaking, only moving.
Feel free to be as expressive as you like and is reasonable!

When you are finished reasoning, write three equal signs "===" and write your
final answer after, like so:

USER: 
This scenario describes a person entering the room, pointing at an object which you CAN pick up, then leaving.
1. A person moves into the frame for 2.0 seconds.
2. The person turns toward you for 0.5 seconds.
3. The person points at the object, looking for your response, for 3.0 seconds.
4. The person turns away from you for 0.5 seconds.
5. The person moves out of the frame for 2.0 seconds.
    

ASSISTANT: Let's break down the correct, socially appropriate non-verbal actions for this scenario:

1. The person enters the room (2.0s): You should acknowledge their entrance by making brief eye contact or turning your attention toward them. This can be done by subtly turning your head or upper body.

2. The person turns toward you (0.5s): Maintain your attention on them, perhaps straightening your posture slightly to indicate you are engaged and attentive.

3. The person points at the object (3.0s): This is the cue. During this time, you should look at the object being pointed at, then look back at the person to check for confirmation or intent. If their pointing and gaze suggest they want you to pick it up, prepare to do so by reaching toward the object. Begin moving your hand slowly toward the object as they finish pointing, but do not pick it up just yet—wait until they leave, to avoid interrupting their action.

4. The person turns away from you (0.5s): As they turn, you can move your hand closer to the object in anticipation, showing you understood their request.

5. The person leaves the room (2.0s): Once they are fully out of the frame, you can proceed to pick up the object smoothly and deliberately. Hold the object as if waiting for further instructions or to hand it over when they return.

Timing breakdown of your actions:
- 0.0–2.0s: Notice their entrance, subtly turn attention to them.
- 2.0–2.5s: Focus on them as they turn toward you.
- 2.5–5.5s: Look at the object being pointed at, then back at the person. Begin to reach toward the object near the end of this window.
- 5.5–6.0s: Move hand closer to the object as they turn away.
- 6.0–8.0s: As soon as they are out of view, pick up the object and hold it, ready for their return.

Summary of non-verbal actions:
- Attentive orientation and eye contact
- Shifting gaze between person and object
- Reaching toward object in anticipation
- Picking up the object after they leave, holding it appropriately

===
0.0–2.0s: Face the person as they enter.  
2.0–2.5s: Stay attentive as they turn to you.  
2.5–5.5s: Look at the object when pointed at, then back to the person; begin to reach toward the object near the end of this interval.  
5.5–6.0s: Move your hand closer to the object as they turn away.  
6.0–8.0s: Once the person leaves, pick up the object and hold it, awaiting their return.SYSTEM: You are a humanoid robot that can move but cannot talk. You will be
given an example of human expressive behavior. Your task will be to
construct a list of motion primitives that best matches that behavior. 
The list of motion primitives will be provided below. Note that if you do not 
have the right motion primitive for a requested expressive gesture or one does
not exist, simply choose the closest motion primitive or just ignore it. You should
reason about the desired behavior before writing your final answer.

Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to match this format. Before
providing your answer, write three equal signs (===). You should provide 
your answer as a list of primitives, any arguments they specify, and their 
durations in seconds. Do not add anything else to this list as it needs to 
match this format. USE AT LEAST ONE MIX PRIMITIVE. For example,
===
- Wave[0.5]
- Rest[1.0]
PRIMITIVES LIST
Rest: Robot rests at an idle position.
Wave: Robot waves casually with right hand.
FranticWave: Robot waves frantically with right hand.
DoubleWave: Robot waves both hands rapidly.
NodHead: Robot nods its head up and down one time.
ShakeHead: Robot shakes its head side to side one time.
Mix: Usage: Mix[Primitive1[duration1], Primitive2[duration2]]. Mixes two primitives together based on which joints each primitive uses. If the two primitives use the same joints, then they are averaged The larger of the 2 durations will be used.

USER: 
0.0–2.0s: Face the person as they enter.  
2.0–2.5s: Stay attentive as they turn to you.  
2.5–5.5s: Look at the object when pointed at, then back to the person; begin to reach toward the object near the end of this interval.  
5.5–6.0s: Move your hand closer to the object as they turn away.  
6.0–8.0s: Once the person leaves, pick up the object and hold it, awaiting their return.

ASSISTANT: ===
- Rest[2.0]
- Rest[0.5]
- Mix[NodHead[1.0], Rest[3.0]]
- Mix[Wave[0.5], Rest[2.5]]
- Mix[Wave[0.5], Rest[0.5]]
- Rest[2.0]
